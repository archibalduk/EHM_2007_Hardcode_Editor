# EHM_2007_Hardcode_Editor
This is an .exe editor for Eastside Hockey Manager 2007 which allows certain hardcoded settings to be edited; such as file paths, competition names, league rules and league structures. Further details can be found here: https://www.ehmtheblueline.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=110&t=12295

The editor has last been compiled using Qt 5.15.2.

Please bear in mind that I wrote this tool whilst still learning C++ and Qt. The code works fine but it could probably be optimised and perhaps a better naming convention used. Nonetheless, it is not spaghetti code, so I expect somebody could quite easily pick up the editor and develop it further.
